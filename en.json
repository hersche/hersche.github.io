You will reconize this, when you change the language - you have to refresh via button after, to reload offline-content (which also got the language). This website is really fresh by technics and i like to stay current here, to learn something more about that HTML5-World. Javascript is also a quite new language to me (2 years), but a funny world. It's not a example for a 'secure language', but its often nice eyecandy and sometimes also usefull (see <a href='http://dev.thoeni.me/peta/plugin.php?plugin=32'>Cardplugin in Peta</a> and also in HTML5). <br />On the other site, i like more serious and mostly <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller'>MVC</a> and <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming'>objectoriented Code</a>. On this site, you become a overview of the projects, which where created out of my computertime.<span style='color: grey;'><h4><a name='security'></a>Chapter Security/Protect Websites</h4>PHP 5 & MySQL 4 - Der leichte Einstieg, Site 309 (it's a german book, i translate):<br />'Ask by random just for some chars of the password - one time the first and third, another time the sixt and fourth char.' More on bottom: 'If you integrate this additional features, you're similiar secure as online-bankingsystems are'</span><hr /> Logic! No, seriously, Security is a important topic, on which you should have two eyes focused. Two of my projects got a local encryption. The others will follow. In PHP i've to figure out a solution, i will do this, when i find time and space for this. It will be similiar implemented as now. <h4><a name='about'></a>About me</h4>The last part is <a href='index.html?s=\"about\"' onclick='changeContent(\"about\"); return false;'>about me</a>. I would like to got a job as dev and also learned this kind of job. After my education, i was working by body, cause 8 hrs pc, 5 days a week for 4 years where too much for me. Now I borke my feed and liked to do something - i never really ended in programming (just reduced), but since april, i am active again, how you see in github. <br />I'm basicly not interessted in donations. Those projects could show, how i could develop. <br /> You could use those projects free and i'm happy, if someone try or fork it (or also report bugs)."

This is a massive performance-improvement for me! The One X is faster than my Laptop (2x1.86Ghz vs. the 4x1.5)! Nice for testing stuff, being up to date but secured. Rooting is still easy through a official way.",
